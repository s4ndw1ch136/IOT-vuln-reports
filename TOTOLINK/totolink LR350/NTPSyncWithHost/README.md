### Analysis

TOTOLINK LR350 V9.3.5u.6369_B20220309 were discovered to contain a command injection vulnerability in the **NTPSyncWithHost** function via the **host_time** parameter. 

The Validity_check function checks the user's packet data, but it is only valid for a specific string and can be bypassed with an unspecified string.

For example, redirections (>, <) can corrupt critical files inside the filesystem, which can lead to a DoS.
